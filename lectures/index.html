<div class="lectures">
	<p>This is a Java programming course for beginners and students who have no or limited knowledge about programming and want to
	gain this knowledge before graduating. Currently five degree courses at the TU Darmstadt participate in this lecture
		i.e Bachelor of Computer Science, Bachelor Economic Computer Science, Psychology in IT and Joint Bachelor of Art. </p>
		
	<p>I read this lecture since 2011. It is offered every winter and summer term once and was founded from the 
		computer science <a href="d120.de">Fachschaft</a> at the Technical University Darmstadt.
	Usually this course takes one week with lecture in the morning and supervised exercises in the afternoon.

	<p>In 2013 Dennis Albrecht joined the team as replacement for <a href="http://felix-kerger.de/">Felix Kerger</a> who helped to organize the course.
	Following the latest lecture material. It is divided into lecture slides and practice tasks.
	Feel free to use it, but refer to my website and name.</p>
