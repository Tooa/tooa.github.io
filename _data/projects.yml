    This is a project on the interactive visualization of social media data. The data
    presentation fuses German Twitter data and a social relation network extracted from
    German online news. Such fusion allows for comparative analysis of the two types of
    media. Our system will additionally enable users to explore relationships between
    named entities, and to investigate events as they develop over time. Cooperative tagging
    of relationships is enabled through the active involvement of users. The system is available
    online for a broad user audience.

    The **KaVE project** is about improving developers experience with C# and Visual Studio.
    One part of the project is to learn about the average developer. To do so, we invite developer to generate (and provide)
    feedback that reflects their interactions with the development environment.

    This includes general actions such as the completion of code, the refactoring of bad code or the navigation
    through any Visual Studio menu. The feedback generation does not disturb the programming flow, data is collected in
    the background and stored on your local hard disk.

    Once in a while, the feedback generator will ask you to provide the generated feedback. You can review
    it and even delete parts of it, before uploading it to our server.
