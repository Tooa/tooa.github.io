- title: Network of the Day
  subtitle: Exploration of time-dependent named entity networks

    “Netzwerk des Tages” (Network of the Day) is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) via a grant from
    <a href="https://www.wissenschaft-im-dialog.de/medien/pressemitteilungen/artikel/beitrag/nachwuchswissenschaftler-erklaeren-die-digitale-welt/">Hochschulwettbewerb 2014</a>.
    The system enables users to explore relationships between named entities, and to investigate events as they develop over time.
    Cooperative tagging of relationships is enabled through the active involvement of users. The system is available online for a broad user audience.
